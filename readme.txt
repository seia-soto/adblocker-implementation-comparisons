We require you to have `zsh` to download filters: see `./scripts/get-filters.zsh` for required binaries on your system.
Also, you need an internet connection on the fresh install.

1. install `node` and `pnpm`
2. (fresh install) run `pnpm install` and `pnpm get-filters`
3. run `pnpm start 'comparison name'`

You can see the list of comparisons from `./src/comparisons`.
